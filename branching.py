# A time traveler has suddenly appeared in your classroom!

# Create a variable representing the traveler's
# year of origin (e.g., year = 2000)
# and greet our strange visitor with a different message
# if he is from the distant past (before 1900),
# the present era (1900-2020) or from the far future (beyond 2020).

# Ask the time traveler what year they are from and change the answer to a number
year = int(input("Greetings! What is your year of origin? "))

#if the year is less than 1900, it means they are from the past
if year < 1900
    print ("Woah, that's the past!")
# Tell them they are from the past
elif 1900 <= year <= 2020:
    #Tell them they are from the present
    print ("That's totally the present!")

    #if the year is greater than 2020, it means they are from the future
else:
    #Tell them theya are from the future 
    print ("Far out, that's the future!!")
